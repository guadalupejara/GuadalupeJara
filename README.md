## Hello!ðŸ‘‹ I'm Guadalupe Jara
**`Digital CraftsWoman - Fullstack Software Developer `**
I'm a full stack developer with a background in anthropology and research. My core values center around creating meaningful impact through my work. I build all my coding projects from the ground up, from the initial ideation and planning phases to creating MVPs and adding those nice-to-have features. As a creative problem solver, I continuously strive to build on my curiousity, expand my developer toolkit and take on new challenges.
